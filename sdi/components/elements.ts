export const CODE = factory('code');

// The HTML `rtc` Element embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of `rb` elements used inside of `ruby` element. `rb` elements can have both pronunciation (rt) and semantic (rtc) annotations.
// NOT SUPPORTED - export const RTC = factory('rtc');

// The HTML `meter` Element represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.
export const METER = factory('meter');

// The HTML Table Body Element (tbody) defines one or more `tr` element data-rows to be the body of its parent `table` element (as long as no `tr` elements are immediate children of that table element.)  In conjunction with a preceding `thead` and/or `tfoot` element, `tbody` provides additional semantic information for devices such as printers and displays. Of the parent table's child elements, `tbody` represents the content which, when longer than a page, will most likely differ for each page printed; while the content of `thead` and `tfoot` will be the same or similar for each page printed. For displays, `tbody` will enable separate scrolling of the `thead`, `tfoot`, and `caption` elements of the same parent `table` element.  Note that unlike the `thead`, `tfoot`, and `caption` elements however, multiple `tbody` elements are permitted (if consecutive), allowing the data-rows in long tables to be divided into different sections, each separately formatted as needed.
export const TBODY = factory('tbody');

// `spacer` is an HTML element which is used for inserting white spaces to web pages. It was created by NetScape for achieving same effect as a single-pixel layout GIF image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages, without actually using a GIF. However `spacer` is not supported by any major browser and same effects can be created with various CSS rules. In Mozilla applications, support for this element was removed in Gecko 2.0. Therefore usage of `spacer` is unnecessary.

// The HTML Teletype Text Element (tt) produces an inline element displayed in the browser's default monotype font.

// NOT SUPPORTED - export const LISTING = factory('listing');

// The HTML `blockquote` Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it).

// The HTML `output` element represents the result of a calculation or user action.
export const OUTPUT = factory('output');

// The HTML `div` element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything.

It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as `article` or `nav) is appropriate.
export const DIV = factory('div');

// The HTML directory element (dir) represents a directory, namely a collection of filenames.

export const CANVAS = factory('canvas');

// The HTML `rp` element is used to provide fall-back parenthesis for browsers non-supporting ruby annotations. Ruby annotations are for showing pronounciation of East Asian characters, like using Japanese furigana or Taiwainese bopomofo characters. The `rp` element is used in the case of lack of `ruby` element support its content has what should be displayed in order to indicate the presence of a ruby annotation, usually parentheses.
export const RP = factory('rp');

// The HTML Subscript Element (sub) defines a span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and often smaller, than the main span of text.
export const SUB = factory('sub');

export const CAPTION = factory('caption');

// The HTML Strikethrough Element (s) renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the `s` element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `s` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the `del` and `ins` elements, as appropriate.
export const S = factory('s');

// The HTML `dialog` element represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as an inspector or window.

// NOT SUPPORTED - export const NOFRAMES = factory('noframes');

export const AREA = factory('area');

export const FORM = factory('form');

// The HTML `hr` element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section).

// The HTML Variable Element (var) represents a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context.

Another example of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.
export const B = factory('b');

// The HTML Table Column Group Element (colgroup) defines a group of columns within a table.
export const COLGROUP = factory('colgroup');

// The HTML `keygen` element exists to facilitate generation of key material, and submission of the public key as part of an HTML form.

// The HTML `ul` element (or HTML Unordered List Element) represents an unordered list of items, namely a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared.

// The HTML Applet Element (applet) identifies the inclusion of a Java applet.

// The HTML Inline Frame Element (iframe) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page. In HTML 4.01, a document may contain a head and a body or a head and a frame-set, but not both a body and a frame-set. However, an `iframe` can be used within a normal document body. Each browsing context has its own session history and active document. The browsing context that contains the embedded content is called the parent browsing context.
